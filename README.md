Main Page | View all books in the Library (Book App)
Search for a Book | Search the Google Books API by `title` or `author` for a book. All the books from the search are then displayed on the screen. You can add a book to the Library (Book App). When adding books to the Library, you can edit the details of the book. 
Remove Book | Remove a book from the Library
Update Book | Update the details of a book (Description, title, author, etc). 

## Stretch Goals
1. CSS/HTML Styling needs to be severely updated and consistent. 
2. `Add Book` button is not working. 
3. Remove/Update? Does it work?
4. Fill the library with books.
